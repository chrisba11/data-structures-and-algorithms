# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is where I am working through code challenges during my courses at Code Fellows and beyond. You can find the work I have completed during my coursework in the *__cf301__* and *__cf401__* folders inside of the *__code-challenges__* folder. Javascript challenges can be found in *__cf301__*, and Python challenges can be found in *__cf401__*.
