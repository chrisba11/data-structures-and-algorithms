# Merge Sort
Funtion to sort an array by splitting the size of the sorted items down to the smallest amount and then merging those portions back together to return the full sorted array.

## Challenge
- Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.
## Approach
- I am still working out my approach, but I've started by creating 4 variables; front_1, end_1, front_2, end_2. Front_1 and end_1 represent the first half of the array and front_2 and end_2 represent the 2nd half of the array. I will fun the method recursively until only 1 element is in each array. Then I will compare front_1 and front_2 and see which is greater and swap them. Then I will step through the 

## Efficiency
To be determined.
